## Save changes to GitHub
The way git works is there is a local repository (your computer) that you commit your changes to first and then you push those commits to the remote repository (GitHub).

**Local Commit**:
1. In Android Studio: click VCS > Commit
2. Enter a commit message
    * Don't be lame and have vague commit messages. Tell others what you are changing.
3. Click Commit
4. It may ask for your GitHub username and email. Just use the same for your GitHub account
5. Click Set and Commit

**Remote Push**:
1. In Android Studio: VCS > Git > Push
2. Click Login In with GitHub...
3. Input your username, password and authenticator code if asked
    * You will need to be added as a contributor to the `SOScodeteam` with write permissions to the `SOS_App`
4. You should see the local commits that have not been pushed to the remote repository
5. Click Push

## Project Overview
**Folders**
- **lib**: Where all the coding for the app is done.
- **android**: contains the build instructions for the android version of the app.
- **ios**: contains the build instructions for the iOS version of the app.
- **assets**: Contains images/fonts to be used in the project

**Files**
- **pubspec.yaml**: Controls dependencies. If you want to use an external library, you will add it here. After you add it you will need to do a Flutter Pub Get. You can also add images and fonts to the project via this file.
- **readme.md**: This file! It's the how to for this app.
   - Helpful readme Editor: https://stackedit.io/app#
   - Paste the readme into the left and a preview is shown on the right

**Firebase**

Firebase is the authentication and database back-end for this application.

To manage the database open the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/) and sign in with the SOS Firebase account.
The login details to this account are pinned to the general channel of our development Slack.

If you need to make changes to how the App links to our Firebase account use the following: [Add Firebase to Flutter](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup)

**App Performance**

If you are running the debug build of the flutter app the performance is going to suffer.  To accurately gauge how the app performs please run

`flutter run --release`

This will build a fully optimized version of the app. Additionally physical devices usually perform better than the simulator.
